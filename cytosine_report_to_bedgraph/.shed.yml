description: Converts genome-wide cytosine methylation report to Bedgraphs
long_description: |
    This tool takes as input a genome-wide cytosine methylation report (generated by the tool Bismark Meth. Extractor) and converts it into a bedGraph for each cytosine context (CpG, CHG and CHH).
    These bedGraphs display, for a given context, the ratio of methylation of each covered cytosine in the genome.

    It also produces a bedGraph displaying the coverage count of each cytosine in the genome (non-covered cytosine are ignored).

    The tool outputs offer the possibility to vizualise the methylation signal of covered cytosines thanks to softwares like IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer).
    In this respect, the tool can optionally generate a tdf binary file (Tiled Data Format) from each converted bedGraph. Tdf format is indeed better handled by IGV than bedGraph.
